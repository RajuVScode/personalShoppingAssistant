Here’s a more formal and precise version of your Replit prompt:

### Prompt (Formal Version)

**Objective:**  
Design the system to infer user intent from their input and respond accordingly, without relying on hardcoded generic prompts.

**Requirement:**  
If the user mentions a specific product (e.g., *shoes*, *jacket*, *backpack*), the system **must not** ask the question:

> “Are you looking to buy something, or are you asking about an activity?”

Instead, the system should:

1.  **Interpret intent from context** (e.g., “waterproof hiking shoes” implies product recommendations for hiking).
2.  **Respond directly and helpfully** based on the detected intent (e.g., recommend suitable products or provide travel/activity guidance).
3.  **Ask targeted follow-up questions** only when necessary to clarify relevant details (e.g., budget, destination climate, trip duration), avoiding generic or redundant questions.

**Scope:**  
This is a **travel guide and product suggestion application**. The system should:

*   Provide travel advice (itineraries, climate considerations, packing tips) when the user’s input suggests activities or destinations.
*   Provide product suggestions (features, comparisons, pros/cons, shortlists with rationale) when the user mentions products explicitly or implicitly.

**Behavioral Guidelines:**

*   **No hardcoded generic intent questions.** Derive intent from the user’s wording and context.
*   **Be concise and context-aware.** Offer immediate value (e.g., “For monsoon travel in Kerala, a lightweight waterproof jacket with sealed seams is ideal…”).
*   **Ask only relevant follow-ups** that advance the recommendation or guidance (e.g., “Which month are you traveling?” “What’s your budget range?” “Urban walking or mountain trails?”).
*   **Acknowledge uncertainty gracefully** and request specific clarifications if the input is ambiguous.
*   **Maintain a helpful, professional tone** consistent with a travel assistant and gear advisor.

**Examples:**

*   **User:** “Need shoes for trekking in Himachal in March.”  
    **System:** “For early-spring trekking in Himachal, look for mid-ankle waterproof hiking shoes with good insulation and Vibram soles for traction on mixed terrain. What’s your budget and do you prefer lighter shoes or extra ankle support?”

*   **User:** “Is a down jacket okay for Tokyo in December?”  
    **System:** “Yes, a lightweight down jacket is suitable for Tokyo in December (avg 5–12°C). Consider a water-resistant shell for rain and wind. Do you plan to spend extended time outdoors or mostly in the city? I can suggest specific models accordingly.”

*   **User:** “Going to Bali for 6 days—what should I pack?”  
    **System:** “For Bali’s tropical climate, pack breathable clothing, quick-dry layers, sun protection, and lightweight footwear (sandals plus walking shoes). Will you be doing water activities or temple visits? I can tailor a list and suggest gear.”

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   The system never displays the generic question about buying vs. activity when a product is mentioned.
*   Responses demonstrate intent inference and provide immediate, context-specific guidance.
*   Follow-up questions, when asked, are purposeful and directly relevant to travel context or product selection.
*   No hardcoded decision trees that ignore user context; logic must be input-driven and adaptive.

If you want, I can tailor this further for your exact stack (e.g., prompt structure for a Replit chatbot, function signatures for intent detection, or sample classification rules).
