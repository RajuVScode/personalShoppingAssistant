Prompt for Replit (Formal & Controlled Execution)
Please refer to the attached architecture diagram and sequence diagram for the AI-driven shopping experience system.
Important:
⚠️ Do NOT start implementation immediately.
I will provide instructions step by step. Your task in this response is only to provide a detailed project plan based on the requirements below.
________________________________________
Objective
Design and implement an AI-powered personalized shopping experience using a multi-agent architecture. The solution must strictly follow the provided diagrams and technical constraints.
________________________________________
High-Level Requirements
1. Technology Stack
•	Backend
o	Python
o	LangChain
o	LangGraph (for agent orchestration and state management)
•	Frontend
o	ReactJS (strictly React; no alternatives)
•	LLM
o	Azure OpenAI
o	Model: gpt-4o-mini
o	Use this model consistently across all agents
•	Vector Store
o	Any suitable vector database compatible with LangChain (e.g., FAISS, Azure AI Search, etc.)
•	Database
o	Persistent database for storing customer profile data
________________________________________
2. Functional Scope
Agents to Implement
Based on the diagrams, the system must include (but is not limited to):
1.	Shopping Experience Agent (Orchestrator)
2.	Clarifier Agent
o	Captures, clarifies, and normalizes user intent
3.	Intent Processor
o	Produces refined / normalized intent
4.	Customer 360 Agent
o	Fetches customer profile, preferences, and historical data from DB
5.	Context Aggregator / Meta Brain Agent
o	Aggregates:
	Refined intent
	Customer context
	Real-time environmental context
6.	Product Recommendation Agent (RAG-based)
o	Uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation on product catalog
________________________________________
3. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
•	I will provide sample data documents for:
o	Customer profile
o	Product catalog
•	Product catalog must be:
o	Embedded
o	Stored in a vector database
o	Queried using semantic search
•	RAG should combine:
o	Refined intent
o	Full aggregated context
o	Retrieved product knowledge
________________________________________
4. External Context Integration
For contextual enrichment, integrate open-source APIs for:
•	Weather data
•	Local events
•	Social trends
(Exact API choices can be proposed in the project plan.)
________________________________________
5. Data Management
•	Customer data must be:
o	Stored in a database
o	Retrieved dynamically during runtime
•	Clearly separate:
o	Transactional customer data (DB)
o	Knowledge data (Vector DB)

What You Need to Do Now
✅ Step 1 (Only This Step)
Provide a detailed project plan that includes:
1.	System Architecture Overview
2.	Agent Responsibilities & Interaction Flow
3.	LangGraph State Design
4.	RAG Pipeline Design
5.	Database & Vector Store Strategy
6.	API Integration Plan for External Context
7.	Frontend–Backend Interaction Plan
8.	Development Phases / Milestones
🚫 Do not generate any code yet.
🚫 Do not assume missing requirements.
✅ Wait for my explicit instruction before starting implementation.
________________________________________
Once the project plan is approved, I will guide you step by step to begin implementation.
